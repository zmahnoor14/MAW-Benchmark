This repository contains all the Jupyter Notebooks used to generate results for the [MAW](https://www.github.com/zmahnoor14/MAW) repository. Two example datasets were used to validate results for MAW, Standards from Diatoms [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.7106205.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7106205) and the Untargeted LCMS-2 data from brypphytes dataset. The .mzML files of these datasets are available on Zenodo.<br>
